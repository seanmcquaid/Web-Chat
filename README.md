# Web Chat

This project was meant to be a playground for utilizing web sockets on both the client and server side. My only issue was being unable to attain full test coverage on the Front End due to issues with mocking socket.io server behavior. I am starting to work on creating my own potential solution for this issue as I felt that there weren't any solid solutions that are well maintained currently within the Front End community.

Basic Requirements :

1. User can register
2. User can login
3. User can have a friends list of available users
4. User can search for a friend to add (Fuzzy search for name / username)
5. User can remove friend from friends list
6. User can message specific user (Time stamp is added on the server side)
7. User can see previous chats with friend
8. User #1 messages are on the left and User #2 messages are on the right, the messages are sorted by date/time order
